        <p>The series is set in a village in the fictional kingdom of Dholakpur. The series revolves around Bheem, sometimes referred to as Chhota Bheem due to his young age, a boy who is strong and intelligent.</p>
        <p>Bheem is a well-loved figure in the village, known for his good heart and helping hand. His closest friends are Chutki, a clever girl; Raju, a brave toddler wearing nothing but his underpants; and a talking monkey called Jaggu.</p>
        <p>The show revolves around Bheem and his team using their skills to solve various problems affecting the village, unravel mysteries, fight evil villains that seek to harm Dholakpur and/or its inhabitants, or foil the plans of their rivals Kalia, Dholu, and Bholu, who aim to embarrass Bheem. Their antics also sometimes get them into trouble.</p>
        <p>Supernatural events have often been used in some episodes like Dholakpur being attacked by the demon Zimbara, the evil witch, or the rival kingdom of Botakpur. Bheem and his team participating in various competitions in Dholakpur or adjoining kingdoms are also a common theme, as is the celebration of Indian festivities and the protection of nature.</p>
